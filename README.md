1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

Animals.java.txt holds the abstract class Animal
Dog.java.txt holds the public class Dog that extends Animal

2. What five objects are created in the main?

1.	List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>()  
2.	new Dog("Fido", 4))				 
3.	new Dog("Fido", 3))
4.	new Dog("Alfie", 4))
5.	new Comparator<Animal>()

3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?

Yes, it is an anonymous class that is defined exactly after it is called but this within the code it is called as can be seen by the placing of the brakcets {}.
